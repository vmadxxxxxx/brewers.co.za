				This promise is the cornerstone of our new applications because we update information on a minute-by-minute basis. (It now seems insane that we only used to do this once a month - as the others <br />still do).
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Our data capturers are <b>constantly</b> working in the background to bring you the latest information and all information is either permission-based or within the public domain.

							Each App is based around one central command - searching.
							<br /><br />
							I'm sure you'll agree that this is a major improvement on the way we used to do it. Modern computer techniques enable us to do this. All data is inter-linked so you can jump seamlessly from people to companies to different Apps with <br />extreme ease.

							Changes happen in our industry all the time (we've monitored around 11% per month in the past) and our new Apps are a great improvement because we no longer update on a monthly basis but minute-by-minute. This really does mean that <b><em>When we know, you know</em></b>.
							<br /><br />
							When you log in to our programs you'll see how many changes and updates have been made since last time you used them. Additionally, any major news will be featured on the Dashboard page.

							<!--Want to remind yourself to resend that email to all managing directors in the Eastern Cape. Save your flags in groups that you define.-->
							In order to speed up the searching process and allow all functions to operate smoothly, we use a flagging system. It's really very simple.
							<br /><br />
							You just flag the items you want to do something with (people, companies, publications etc.) and then choose what action you want to perform - whether that's simply printing out details or emailing or composing mail merge letters.
							<br /><br  />
							<!--It's very well explained in the Help section and if you're still unsure please remember you can phone Tracey or myself at just about anytime.-->
